# Neural-Style-Transfer
<h1><strong>Motivation</strong></h1>
<p>Neural style transfer is an optimization technique used to take three images, a content image, a style reference image (such as an artwork by a famous painter), and the input image you want to style — and blend them together such that the input image is transformed to look like the content image, but “painted” in the style of the style image.This is a technique outlined in Leon A. Gatys’ paper, A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style, which is a great read, and you should definitely check it out.</p>
